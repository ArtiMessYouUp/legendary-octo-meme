Project: Run Forest Run 

This is a game developed with the help of ClearCode on YouTube. This channel provided the sprites needed as well as a detailed guide on how to use pygame.

Description

Good morning, afternoon, or night Prof.! This is the game I ended up doing for my project. I used Visual Studio Code with the Python extension as well as imports from “pygame” and “random”.  My game is a simple runner game where you try to survive as long as possible by jumping over obstacles or walking right under them.

I used visual studio code with the python extension due to ease of use based on previous projects. I decided to use pygame instead of a game engine so I could learn more about how to build the entire game from scratch. 

Some challenges I faced was somehow breaking my code while following along because I wanted to do somethings that were not similar to the tutorial. This did however help me get better at debugging and writing code. I also at the time of writing this ran into the issue of not knowing how to move files where I can use the code on any computer. 

Some features I would like to add in the future is a sound when you die in the game, a ducking mechanism for the fly obstacles, a high-score tracker, and loop the background music.

Instructions

After the game is started, the space bar is all that is needed. Press the space bar in order to jump over obstacles. Once you die in the game, press the spacebar to start again!
